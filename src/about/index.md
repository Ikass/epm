We are a Latvia-based management and development consultancy, providing services to public sector clients, within the framework of EU external development aid projects. 

Our clients include public sector institutions on all levels and civil society organisations, mainly in transition and developing countries.

We specialise in providing professional institutional capacity development, practical training programmes, policy reform advisory and sustainable knowledge transfer in various sectors.

Our core areas of expertise include:

- Governance and Public Administration;
- Parliamentary development;
- Education, VET and Training;
- Justice and Legislation;
- EU Integration and legal approximation;
- Employment and Social Policy;
- Agriculture and Rural Development;
- Information and Communication Technologies;
- Regional Development.

We work closely with public sector institutions in Latvia – line ministries and various agencies – to facilitate transfer of EU best practices, experience and knowledge to developing countries.

Therefore, the organisation of experience-exchange programmes, study visits, internships and training in Latvia is one of the strong competences of EPM. This provides EPM with an opportunity to invite experts from public institutions as long-term or short-term experts for the EU projects, and to have the support and commitments of the Latvian public sector institutions.
