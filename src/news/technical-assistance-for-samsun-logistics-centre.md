Project - Technical Assistance for Samsun Logistics Centre (EuropeAid/136227/IH/SER/TR).

Value of the contract: 2 407 575 EUR

The objective of this contract is to develop the institutional and operational capacity of the Samsun Logistics Centre Management Company for efficient and effective management of the Samsun Logistics Centre.

The project will provide technical assistance for establishment of the Samsun Logistics Centre Management Company (SLC-MC) and operations of the SLC-MC during the initial phase of its business life.

In due course, the Project is composed of two components, first of which will support the establishment of the SLC-MC by development of a business model and business plan for this entity, and facilitating establishment of the systems (e.g. HR, operations, finance, quality assurance etc.), structures (i.e. business units) and tools (e.g. service level agreements, contract templates etc.) that will be needed for implementing business model and business plan. The first component of the Operation is expected to be completed within one year upon signature of service contract.

The second component can be described as the operationalization of the SLC-MC business model and business plan. This component of the Project will improve the institutional capacity of the SLC-MC, and provide support to the SLC-MC on operating the SLC and on monitoring and evaluating its operational and financial performance.

These two components of the Project will be complemented by activities towards ensuring the visibility of the Operations as well as the SLC-MC.

The target group of the Project is the small and medium-sized enterprises.
