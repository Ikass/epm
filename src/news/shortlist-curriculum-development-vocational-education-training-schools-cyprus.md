#### **Contract Description:**

The purpose of this contract is to support the preparation of a new modularised curriculum, based on the revised Occupational Standards (OS) for all occupations delivered at the VET schools, with the aim of increasing knowledge, skills and competences of students and their employability, and thus better linking the education programmes with the labour market needs.

The action will specifically focus on the following:

- prepare a methodology for the preparation and revision of the curriculum;
- develop the capacity of teachers on preparation and revision of the new modularised curriculum;
- with the participation of locally developed capacity prepare the new modularised curriculum and the linked training materials for VET programmes based on the revised OS;
- prepare the testing and evaluation mechanism linked to the newly developed training curricula;
- set up 3 resource centres.
