European Projects Management Ltd. has been shortlisted for the EuropeAid project contract, in consortium with WEglobal.

#### Project Title:

Â **EU4Digital: Improving Cyber Resilience in the Eastern Partnership Countries (Cybersecurity component)**

#### Location:

Eastern Neighbourhood partner countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Republic of Moldova, Ukraine)

#### Project Reference:

[EuropeAid/140015/DH/SER/Multi](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/europeaid/online-services/index.cfm?ADSSChck=1562151258338&do=publi.detPUB&ccnt=7573877&searchtype=AS&orderby=upd&orderbyad=Desc&page=4&debpub=&nbPubliList=15&aoet=36539&aoref=140015&userlanguage=en)

#### **Contract Description:**

This contract refers to the **Cybersecurity component** (number 1) of the "EU4Digital: Improving Cyber Resilience in the Eastern Partnership Countries" regional programme.

The programme will contribute to improving the cyber-resilience and criminal justice response of EaP Partner countries and will focus on two key building blocks: (i) cybersecurity; and (ii) cybercrime. The cybersecurity component subject to this contract will focus on the development of technical and cooperation mechanisms that increase cybersecurity and preparedness against cyber-attacks, such as strengthening the institutional governance and legal framework, developing the critical information infrastructure protection, and increasing cyber incidents and crisis management capacities.

Focusing on the added value that a regional programme brings in, a sub-regional approach is also sought (e.g. activities involving only 3 countries). This is to take into account the diverse level of advancement in the cybersecurity domain in each country, the geographical and geopolitical specificities in the region, as well as the principle of differentiation. Furthermore, the implementation of this action will have to take into account the country initiatives being implemented in the cyber area, particularly those funded by the EU.

The Cyber resilience programme clearly follows the Council conclusions of 26 June 2018 on the EU External Cyber Capacity Building Guidelines and the documents referred to therein.
