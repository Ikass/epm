[EuropeAid/140723/DH/SER/UA](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/europeaid/online-services/index.cfm?ADSSChck=1599214938995&do=publi.welcome&nbPubliList=15&aofr=140723&searchtype=RS&orderbyad=Desc&orderby=upd&userlanguage=en)

#### **Contract Description:**

The project will support ongoing policy and institutional reforms in Ukraineâ€™s Agriculture and Rural Development (ARD) sector based on an approved strategic action plan and the Association Agreement between the EU and the government of Ukraine. The project will notably contribute to more inclusive, competitive growth-orientated agriculture that respects the environment, increases rural incomes and slows down rural-urban migration. The project will operate at central but also at decentralized government levels. At central level, the project will support the government to develop effective evidence-based policy analysis and monitoring, and further approximate Ukrainian legislation. At decentralised level, the project will assist Oblasts and Amalgamated Territorial communities (ATCs) to actually and efficiently implement national strategy/policy/institutional reforms linked to ARD through capacity building, technical assistance, training, information and advisory support.
